## What is Subject Registration?

Subject Registration allows teachers to assign students to specific subjects. This is useful when:
- A subject (like Science, Art, or Commercial) is taken by students across different streams/classes
- You need to track which students are enrolled in which subjects
- Multiple teachers teach the same subject to different groups

## Removing a Student from a Subject

2. Find the student's name in the table
3. Click **"Remove"** button
4. Confirm when asked
5. The student is now unregistered

## What Happens After Registration

Once students are registered:
- Teachers can see which students are enrolled in their subjects
- Attendance can be taken for registered students
- Results can be entered for registered students
- Reports can show subject-wise student lists

## Status Options

Each registration has a status:
- **Active** - Student is currently taking this subject
- **Dropped** - Student no longer takes this subject
- **Suspended** - Student temporarily suspended from this subject

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Register at the beginning of term** - Do bulk registrations when the term starts
2. **Keep notes updated** - Use notes to track stream assignments or special arrangements
3. **Review regularly** - Check the summary to ensure all students are properly registered
4. **Coordinate with teachers** - Ensure all stream teachers register their students
5. **Handle changes quickly** - Remove students promptly when they drop a subject

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Student does not belong to this class"
- **Cause**: You're trying to register a student for a class they're not in
- **Solution**: Select the correct class for that student

### Issue: "You are not assigned to this class"
- **Cause**: Teachers can only manage their assigned classes
- **Solution**: Contact admin to assign you to that class, or ask admin to register

### Issue: "Student is already registered for this subject"
- **Cause**: The student is already registered for this subject/class combo
- **Solution**: No action needed - they're already registered

### Issue: Cannot see Subject tab
- **Cause**: Admin functionality not enabled for your role
- **Solution**: Ask the system administrator to give you appropriate permissions

## Data Stored

For each registration, the system records:
- Student name & ID
- Subject name & ID
- Class
- Who registered them & when
- Any notes added
- Current status

This creates a complete audit trail for all subject assignments.
